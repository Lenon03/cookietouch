## move
- Value: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array<{ map; path; gather; fight; npcBank; phenix; door; custom }></a>

Contains the path and most actions of the bot.

It is important that the bot is in one of the maps of the move path to start it.

```js
const move = [
  { map: "67371008", custom: usePotion },
]

function* usePotion() {
if (currentMapId === 67371008) {
  yield* inventory.useItem(6965);
  yield* delay(1000);
}
```

## bank
- Value: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array<{ map; path; gather; fight; npcBank; phenix; door; custom }></a>

Contains the path to the bank.

The bot will automatically use this path when it has exceeded the maximum pod percentage [MAX_PODS](Configuration.md#max_pods).

It is important that the bot is in one of the bank path maps to start it.

```js
const bank = [
  { map: "11,9", path: "right" },
  { map: "12,9", path: "top" },
  { map: "12,8", path: "right" },
  { map: 88081177, door: 216 }, // External map of the bank
  { map: 99095051, npcBank: true, path: "410" } // Inside the bank. "410" corresponds to the cell to exit the bank.
]
```
Here, the mapId are used to differentiate the inside from the outside of the bank (the bot does not change map by entering the bank, it remains in "13.8").

npcBank is set to true, so the bot will open the bank and execute the predefined actions in [Configuration](Configuration.md).

## phenix
- Value: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array<{ map; path; gather; fight; npcBank; phenix; door; custom }></a>

Contains the path to the phenix.

It is important that the bot is in one of the maps of the phenix path to start it.

This is not a mandatory route if the bot does not fight and has no risk of becoming a ghost.
